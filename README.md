## Who am I? 🤔

🎓 I'm a student of **System Analysis and Development**, currently diving into technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Python** , **Bootstrap**.

👨‍💻 I'm passionate about creating creative and innovative solutions, always seeking new challenges in software development. My mission is to become a developer as skilled as **Luffy** is determined to become the Pirate King! 🏴‍☠️👑

- **HTML** 🖼️
- **CSS** 🎨
- **JavaScript** ⚡
- **Python** 🐍
- **Java** ☕
- And of course, always learning more with **Bootstrap** and other front and back-end tools! 🚀





## A little about me 💭

I'm a true **anime** fan and try to apply **Naruto's** 🍥 determination and **Goku's** 🔥 focus to everything I do. If you're also a fan of tech and otaku culture, we're already friends! 😄

In my free time, I enjoy:

- Watching anime (💡 current recommendation: *Dan dan dan* 🕵️‍♂️🔍)
- Developing projects like websites 🎨 (I'm working on one about **Brazilian music** 🇧🇷🎶)
- Diving into code and learning something new every day 💻✨



## "Every programmer has their own style, just like every character has their hidden power!" 🌟

With every new project, I feel closer to becoming the **"Hokage of Devs"**! 👨‍💻🔥
